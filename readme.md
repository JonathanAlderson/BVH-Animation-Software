BVH Animation Software
======

Animation software that is capable of loading and displaying BVH files.
Global positions are calculated through forward kinematics.

Limbs can be controlled through local rotations or through inverse kinematics.

Animations can be created through keyframing, where poses are linearly interpolated between.

Allows for control of multiple points, dampening and gain values.
